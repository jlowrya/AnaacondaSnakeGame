# AnaacondaSnakeGame
 
The idea of the game is to make a snake game that can somehow allude to the great 'Anaconda' song by Nicki Minaj. 

## Rules
Move the snake around the map while avoiding running into other parts of the snake and eating mice and buns.

### Mice
Mice appear on the screen as grey squares and are used to increase the size of the snake.

### Buns
Buns appear on the screen as beige squares and are to be collected. Upon collecting 3 buns, the snake will transform temporarily into an anaconda, which can move through walls and (potentially) eat itself (tbd).
